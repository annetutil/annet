To learn more about Annet and try it out first-hand, check out our cool laboratory at `GitHub <https://github.com/annetutil/contribs/tree/main/labs>`_ .
In it, you will write some generators, deploy configurations, and understand how changes in the inventory are reflected in configurations through Annet.
